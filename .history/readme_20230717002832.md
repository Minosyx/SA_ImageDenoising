# Image denoising using SVD, FFT and Wavelet transforms

## 1. Introduction

This project was created to compare the performance of different image denoising techniques. All the techniques were implemented in Python and for the frontend I used the [Shiny for Python](https://shiny.posit.co/py/) library which is a port of the R Shiny library. Most of the functionality of the Shiny package for Python is an exact copy of the R Shiny library, so if you are familiar with R Shiny you will have no problem using this library.

The differences between those two libraries are as follows:

- Decorators are used instead of functions
- Function names are used to connect outputs to the UI
- More precise namespaces
- All inputs are invoked with `input.<input_name>()`
- Some functions have different names
- No library for managing JavaScript so you have to write it yourself as of now

I used Shiny for Python because I wanted to create a web application that would be easy to use, neatly organized and look good out of the box. It was also a great choice because I wanted to enable users to upload their own images and adjust the parameters of the denoising algorithms.

On top of that, the libraries used to realize the project are:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - for matrix operations and SVD decomposition
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) - for FFT and Wavelet transforms
- [shinyswatch](https://github.com/rstudio/py-shinyswatch) - for the UI theme
- [io](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html) - for downloading the image
- [imageio](https://imageio.readthedocs.io) - for reading and saving images

## 2. Step by step guide

User is presented with a simple UI looking like this:

On the top there is an upload button which allows the user to upload an image of choice.
Below that we can see a select box with all the implemented denoising algorithms.
Selecting an algorithm will display the parameters that can be adjusted for that method. If we upload the image we can then try to denoise it using the selected algorithm.
The preview of the image is displayed on the right side of the screen. The user can also download the image by clicking the download button after the image has been denoised.

All the parameters that user can modify will be described in the sections dedicated to each algorithm.
