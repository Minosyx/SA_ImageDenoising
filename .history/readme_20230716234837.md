# Image denoising using SVD, FFT and Wavelet transforms

## 1. Introduction

This project was created to compare the performance of different image denoising techniques. All the techniques were implemented in Python and for the frontend I used the [Shiny for Python](https://shiny.posit.co/py/) library which is a port of the R Shiny library. Most of the functionality of the Shiny package for Python is an exact copy of the R Shiny library, so if you are familiar with R Shiny you will have no problem using this library.

The differences between those two libraries are as follows:

- Decorators are used instead of functions
- Function names are used to connect outputs to the UI
- More precise namespaces
- All inputs are invoked with `input.<input_name>()`
- Some functions have different names
- No library for managing JavaScript so you have to write it yourself as of now

I used Shiny for Python because I wanted to create a web application that would be easy to use, neatly organized and look good out of the box. It was also a great choice because I wanted to enable users to upload their own images and adjust the parameters of the denoising algorithms.
